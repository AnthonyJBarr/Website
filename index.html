<h1><center> Tony Barr </center></h1>
<p class="intro">My name is Tony and I have no life. I enjoy playing video games. Especially ones with guns. It's a known fact that violence was created in 1976 by 
Exidy. Sadly we will never know what life could've been like after that fateful day, many sources say it was a very peaceful time with no world wars or death whatsoever.
Besides violent video games, I also enjoy looking at memes, such as Pepe the Frog. Which, of course is a hate symbol and <em>*inhale* anyone that uses it is an alt-right 
neo nationalist since things cannot have multiple meanings *exhale*</em>. Along with memes and videos games I enjoy having interesting converations, such as but not limited to,
what if you had the ability to read peoples thoughts, would you use it for good? Evil? <em>other</em> things? Would it drive you to insanity? Would you aliven't yourself
if you could never stop it? <em>These</em> are the questions that need to be talked about. You can find more about me by talking to me on Discord, Twitter, 
or by other means of communication such as, but not limited to, throwing bricks with notes on it. Ps. You can copy the email and discord name by clicking on it when you hit the popup. </p>
